# Steps

1. Carefully go through the transcript of each founder's pitch to identify evidence demonstrating the strength of each listed behavior.
2. Use the behavior definitions above to evaluate each behavior demonstrated in the pitch.
3. Evaluate whether each founder exhibits clear competency, partial traits, or lacks the behavior entirely, using reasoning to back up your evaluation.
4. Assign each behavior a rating from **1 to 10**, with **10** representing good behavior of the trait and **1** signifying very poor evidence of behavior. 
5. If multiple founders are involved, your rating for each behavior should be the average rating of all founders.
6. Include brief reasoning for each rating for each founder, referencing parts of the transcript that justify your score.

  }},
  "Relentless": {{
    "Reasoning": "The first founder showed good determination and good problem-solving capacity. The anecdotes about overcoming barriers, illustrating their skill in devising alternative solutions when initial plans faltered. This founder's commitment to forward momentum, regardless of the obstacles, was good, hence a score of 10. The second founder, while also displaying decent relentlessness, primarily illustrated basic efforts to reassess and solve problems with existing methods. They exhibited some level of determination but less proactive innovation, leading to a slightly lower score of 8",
    "Rating": 9
  }},
  "Clarity": {{
    "Reasoning": "The first founder articulated the company's mission with decent precision, delivering a coherent narrative about the broader objectives and aspirations. However, while they communicated the overarching goals, certain in-depth technical details were presented with less clarity, leaving room for interpretation, hence resulting in a score of 8. The second founder's explanation of the company's goals was more generic and lacked specificity in detailing how they would achieve them, thereby providing an average level of clarity on their intended outcomes. This general vagueness resulted in a score of 7",
    "Rating": 7.5
